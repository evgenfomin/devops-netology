 history-size (unset)
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and  no  new  entries
              are saved.  If set to a value less than zero, the number of history entries is not limited.  By default, the number of history entries is set to the
              value of the HISTSIZE shell variable.  If an attempt is made to set history-size to a non-numeric value, the maximum number of history entries  will
              If set to On, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (*).

       { list; }
              list  is  simply executed in the current shell environment.  list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.
              The return status is the exit status of list.  Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur  where  a  re‚Äê
              served  word  is  permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell
              metacharacter.
